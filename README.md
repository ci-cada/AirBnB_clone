## Description of the project

HolbertonBnB is a complete web application that intergrates; a database storage, a back-end API that provides a communication and a front-end interfacing as a clone of AirBnB.

This project currently only implements the back end console.

## Classes

## Storage

## The console
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the back end of HolbertonBnB i.e. creating updating and destroying.
It can be used to handle and manipulate all the classes used by the application.

### Execution
The console can run both interactively and non-interactively.

To run the console in interactive mode, run the file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit

```

To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into the execution of the `console.py` file at the command line:

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
```
